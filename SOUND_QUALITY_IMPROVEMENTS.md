# Piano Sound Quality Improvements

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive improvements made to fix the "DVR static" sound issue and achieve realistic piano audio output.

## Problem Analysis

The original piano synthesizer was producing static-like artifacts instead of musical piano tones due to several fundamental issues:

1. **Numerical Instability**: The wave equation solver was unstable, causing oscillations to grow uncontrollably
2. **Poor Parameter Values**: Physics constants were unrealistic, leading to harsh, unnatural sounds
3. **Inadequate Damping**: Insufficient damping allowed unwanted frequencies to accumulate
4. **Aliasing Issues**: High-frequency harmonics were causing aliasing artifacts
5. **Buffer Management Problems**: Audio processing was creating clicks and pops

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. String Model Enhancements (`core/physics/string_model.cpp`)

#### Numerical Stability Fixes
- **CFL Condition Enforcement**: Added stability checks to ensure `dx > c * dt * 0.5`
- **Acceleration Limiting**: Clamped acceleration values to prevent numerical explosion
- **Displacement Bounds**: Limited string displacement to physically reasonable values
- **Velocity Clamping**: Prevented velocity from reaching unstable values

#### Realistic Physics Parameters
- **Improved Damping**: Increased base damping from `0.001` to `0.015-0.03` (frequency-dependent)
- **Better String Dimensions**: More realistic string diameter and length calculations
- **Tension Scaling**: Adjusted tension calculation for more natural frequency response
- **Stiffness Reduction**: Reduced stiffness coefficient to prevent harsh metallic sounds

#### Enhanced Harmonic Generation
- **Frequency Limiting**: Limited harmonics to prevent aliasing (`max_freq < sample_rate/4`)
- **Exponential Decay**: Implemented realistic harmonic decay curves
- **Phase Coherence**: Improved phase relationships between harmonics
- **Blend Factor**: Mixed physical and harmonic models for better sound quality

#### Code Example - Improved Excitation:
```cpp
// Old problematic approach
harmonic_amplitudes_[h] = force * sin(harmonic_num * PI * position) * pow(0.8, h);

// New stable approach
double position_factor = sin(harmonic_num * PI * position);
double harmonic_decay = exp(-0.3 * h);
double freq_response = 1.0 / (1.0 + 0.1 * h * h);
double amplitude = excitation_force_ * position_factor * harmonic_decay * freq_response;
```

### 2. Hammer Model Improvements (`core/physics/hammer_model.cpp`)

#### Contact Dynamics
- **Hysteresis**: Added contact detection with hysteresis to prevent chattering
- **Smoother Force Calculation**: Implemented gentler contact force curves using `tanh()`
- **Velocity Smoothing**: Applied smoothing to compression velocity calculations
- **Force Limiting**: Capped maximum contact forces to prevent harsh transients

#### Enhanced Physics
- **Improved Integration**: Better numerical integration with position constraints
- **Damping Adjustments**: Increased air resistance and contact damping for stability
- **Felt Modeling**: More realistic felt hardness effects on contact stiffness

### 3. Synthesizer Processing (`core/synthesis/piano_synthesizer.cpp`)

#### Audio Processing Pipeline
- **Anti-aliasing Filter**: Added simple one-pole lowpass filter to reduce high-frequency content
- **Gentle Compression**: Implemented soft limiting with smooth transitions
- **Stereo Imaging**: Improved stereo panning using equal-power panning laws
- **Reverb Simulation**: Added simple delay-based reverb for spatial depth

#### Voice Management
- **Velocity Clamping**: Ensured MIDI velocity stays within reasonable bounds
- **Enhanced Envelopes**: Implemented more realistic piano decay curves
- **Strike Parameter Variation**: Varied strike position and force based on velocity
- **Smooth Release**: Exponential release curves instead of linear
- **String Noise & Decay**: Basic oscillator now injects gentle noise and
  automatically decays amplitude to mimic real string vibration

#### Code Example - Improved Audio Processing:
```cpp
// Anti-aliasing filter
static double prev_output = 0.0;
double alpha = 0.85; // Simple one-pole filter
output = alpha * output + (1.0 - alpha) * prev_output;
prev_output = output;

// Gentle saturation
output = std::tanh(output * 5.0) * 0.2;
```

### 4. Configuration Updates (`config/piano_config.json`)

#### Optimized Parameters
- **Reduced Buffer Size**: Changed from 512 to 256 samples for lower latency
- **Lower Master Volume**: Reduced from 0.8 to 0.6 to prevent clipping
- **Improved Physics**: Updated string tension, damping, and stiffness values
- **Voice Limitation**: Reduced max voices from 128 to 64 for better performance

#### New Parameter Values
```json
{
  "physics": {
    "string": {
      "tension_base": 800.0,    // Reduced from 1000.0
      "damping": 0.015,         // Increased from 0.001
      "stiffness": 5e-6,        // Reduced from 1e-5
      "coupling_strength": 0.05 // Reduced from 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Enhanced Constants (`core/utils/constants.h`)

#### Physics Constants
- **Realistic Tensions**: Reduced base string tension for softer attack
- **Improved Damping**: Increased default damping coefficients
- **Hammer Properties**: Lighter hammer mass, softer contact
- **Harmonic Limits**: Reduced max harmonics to prevent aliasing

### 6. DSP Utilities (`core/utils/math_utils.cpp`)

#### Better Audio Processing
- **Improved Soft Clipping**: Smoother compression curves
- **Enhanced Saturation**: Better `tanh()` saturation implementation
- **Numerical Safety**: Added bounds checking and error handling

## Testing and Validation
